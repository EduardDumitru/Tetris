# Tetris
It's a game of tetris I made following the bloc.io tutorial for Swift called Swiftris. It was made for Swift 2 or 3 I believe, but I changed the code to follow the structure of Swift 4.2 . 
It had some bugs when I first run it on my machine, but now I believe is 99% ok. If you find any bugs you can report it to me or help me resolve them. 
I had fun following this tutorial and I recommend it to everyone who is giving Swift a try. You won't regret it. Especially that it makes you search some stuff on Google that won't work on your newer machine.

Unfortunately I can't run the sound on my virtual machine, but I commented the places where sound should have been. You can try it yourself.
